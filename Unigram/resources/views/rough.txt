**Roadmap: University Event Platform Using Laravel**

### **1. Project Setup & Planning**
- Define key features and user roles (University, Student)
- Set up Laravel project (`composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel UniEvents`)
- Configure `.env` file with database credentials

### **2. Database Design & Migration**
- Create `users` table with `role` column (`student` or `university`)
- Create `universities` table (id, name, logo, description)
- Create `events` table (id, title, description, date, university_id, image)
- Create `comments` and `likes` tables
- Run migrations (`php artisan migrate`)

### **3. Authentication & Role Management**
- Use Laravel Breeze/Jetstream for authentication
- Add role-based middleware (`isUniversity()`, `isStudent()`) in `User` model
- Restrict access to posting for universities only

### **4. Event Management**
- Universities can create, edit, delete events
- Store event details in the database
- Implement file upload for event images

### **5. Student Interaction Features**
- Students can log in but not post events
- Allow students to like, comment, and follow universities
- Implement AJAX for real-time engagement

### **6. Event Display & Search System**
- Display a feed of university events
- Implement search and filter options (by university, category, date)
- Add pagination for scalability

### **7. Notifications & Updates**
- Use Laravel Broadcasting/WebSockets for real-time updates
- Notify students when their university posts a new event

### **8. Responsive UI & Design**
- Use TailwindCSS/Bootstrap for frontend design
- Ensure mobile-friendly interface

### **9. Deployment & Security**
- Host the website on VPS (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.)
- Use Laravel Forge/Envoyer for deployment
- Perform security testing (SQL Injection, XSS prevention)

### **10. Future Enhancements**
- Implement event reminders via Email/SMS
- Add university verification process
- Track event engagement with analytics
